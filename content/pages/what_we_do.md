We grow organic vegetables and fruit on four allotment plots. We have two polytunnels and two greenhouses where we grow tomatoes, chillies, peppers, cucumbers and other vegetables that benefit from being grown under cover. Outside we grow a wide range of vegetables including potatoes, onions, various types of squash and courgettes, cabbages, broccoli and peas and beans.  We also have some fruit trees and different types of soft fruit such as strawberries, raspberries, blackcurrants and gooseberries.

Users and volunteers are encouraged to suggest new vegetables and fruit they would like to grow.

You do not need any previous gardening experience to join HOPE. There is a wide range of tasks and activities on the sites that you can get involved in and we provide all the tools, seeds and equipment you need.  More experienced volunteers are also available to offer friendly help and advice about growing fruit and vegetables.
