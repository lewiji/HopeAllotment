## Andrea Hardy – HOPE’s Founder
Andrea Hardy was the inspiration behind HOPE Community Allotment Project. She died peacefully, aged 57, in July 2013 after a short but brave battle with illness.  She will be remembered with love and affection by many people in Sheffield.

For the last 15 years of her life, Andrea focussed her energies on community projects in the Firth Park area. In 2000, together with her good friend Betty Smalley, she established the Firth Park Festival and was a leading light in organizing the event with other members of the local community until 2010.  In 1999 Andrea helped to launch the Trade Base Trust which operated from the old library on Firth Park Road.  The building became the focal point for a wide range of community activities which included a recycling centre selling second hand goods, adult education classes, a lunch club, parent and toddler groups and a host of other self-help groups too numerous to mention.

In 2004 Andrea’s love for gardening blossomed into the project that now bears her name, the HOPE Community Allotment project or Hardy’s Organic Produce for Everyone. From small beginnings Hope has grown year by year and now has four plots on the High Wincobank allotment site on Windmill Lane, one of which has specially constructed raised beds that are suitable for people with mobility problems. At the Hope Community Allotment local people from all parts of the community and with diverse levels of ability and disability work together to grow organic fruit and vegetables, caring and supporting each other and our local environment. We were guided by Andrea’s vision while she was with us and now follow the example she set us, in fond memory of her.

## Betty Smalley

Betty Smalley who died in January 2019 at the age of 88, was a well-known figure in many community-based organisations in north east Sheffield, especially in Firth Park and Burngreave. She took a keen interest in environmental issues joining the newly formed Green City Action (GCA) in 1982. GCA had been established to promote recycling and, later on, gardening projects. It operated initially in Burngreave but extended its work to Firth Park when Trade Base was launched in 2000.  This led to Betty’s involvement in Trade Base where she became an active member of the committee and took on the key role of treasurer.  She was also a founding member of Friends of Firth Park and helped run the annual Firth Park Festival in the park.  Betty’s Tea Tent became a regular feature of the festival with the money raised going to the festival itself.   

Over time Trade Base’s activities contracted leaving its gardening project, HOPE Community Allotment, as its only project.  Betty was actively involved in the allotment committee and continued in her role as treasurer until 2013.  She regularly attended events and activities organised by HOPE and the highlight of her year was the annual allotment trip to the seaside where she relished eating fish and chips on the sea front.

Betty had a great interest in local history.  She campaigned to have the Clock Tower in Firth Park restored after an arson attack in the 1990s and more recently has been a key member of Friends of Burngreave Cemetery Chapels which aims to restore the buildings to their former glory. For the last 12 years she helped transcribe burials records for internet access, an activity which enabled her to continue contributing to the community despite her increasing frailty.

In 2007, when Jackie Drayton was Lord Mayor, Betty was honoured with the title Sheffield’s Woman of Inspiration.  This is a very apt description of Betty who indeed has been an inspiration to us all over many decades.

## Sheila Waugh
Shelagh Waugh was another active supporter of community activities in the Firth Park area.  She passed away in September 2014 at the age of 70.  Originally from London, Shelagh moved to Sheffield in 1990 to do a diploma in social work at Sheffield University.  She lived close to the Old Firth Park Library and the Clock Tower and quickly got involved in community activities, forming a close bond with Andrea Hardy and Betty Smalley. She ran the recycling centre and second-hand shop in the Old Library together with a group of Trade Base volunteers.  She also ran a junior youth club at the Clock Tower and thoroughly enjoyed organising children’s games and activities as part of the Firth Park Summer Festival.  Before she became ill, she was a regular volunteer at the allotment making sure that everyone got their tea and biscuits at the right time and taking her turn at making the lunchtime soup that has become a feature of the allotment sessions.   

Shelagh lived by the motto “*Live for yourself and you will live in vain, live for others and you will live again.*”  

As her husband, Colin, said at her funeral:

*“She set the interests of other before her own, not as a way of putting them in her debt, but because she wholeheartedly identified their interests as her own.  It was as if she felt that her own enjoyment of life was incomplete unless others could share it.”*
