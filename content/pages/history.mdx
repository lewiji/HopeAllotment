HOPE Community Allotment Project was established by Trade Base, a local community group which brought local people together with the aim of regenerating Firth Park, Shiregreen and Brightside. The group secured European Regional Development Funding to develop recycling, re-use and restoration activities which would be of benefit to local people. The group campaigned to secure the lease of the old Firth Park Library to use as a base for community activities, and in November 1999 Trade Base was launched. The centre was officially opened by David Blunkett MP.

Trade Base ran a very successful recycling project which provided furniture, household goods, clothes, books and toys to local people at affordable costs. The project was instrumental in preventing many tonnes of waste materials from landfill. Other community activities provided by Trade Base included education courses, computer training courses for school leavers, a ‘drop in’ for unemployed people as well as social and recreation activities for all ages.

Trade Base was also the home to many local community groups, including a lunch club and under-fives groups.  Free support and advice enabled groups to continue providing their specialist community activities.

## All change at Trade Base.

The ERDF funding finished and a lottery application to purchase the building lease, money for salaries and building improvements was unsuccessful. The project was now running on its reserves, small grants and funds raised from the sale of goods. The Management Committee had to make some hard choices and staffing was reduced to one part time worker.

A feasibility study was carried out and options were discussed. A plan was developed to continue the project on a smaller scale and to apply for funds for some new outdoor activities.



## The Birth of the Allotment Project.

During 2004 a small sub-group developed an action plan and was successful in securing Objective One funding to develop a community allotment project based on two allotment plots on the High Wincobank Allotment site on Windmill Lane. Then in 2007 we were successful in obtaining a grant from the Big Lottery's Reaching Communities Fund.  This enabled us to fund 2 full time workers for 3 years and to develop the project even further. Although we met all our targets we failed to get any further significant funding from the Big Lottery or other sources at the end of the three years.

Since 2011 the project has been run by a group of dedicated volunteers on a purely voluntary basis.  Their commitment and hard work as enabled the project to continue to provide a valuable service to local residents.
