The group\n            secured European Regional Development Funding to develop recycling,\n            re-use and restoration activities which would be of benefit to local\n            people. The group campaigned to secure the lease of the old Firth\n            Park Library to use as a base for community activities, and in\n            November 1999 Trade Base was launched. The centre was officially\n            opened by David Blunkett MP.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Trade Base ran a very successful recycling project which provided\n            furniture, household goods, clothes, books and toys to local people\n            at affordable costs. The project was instrumental in preventing many\n            tonnes of waste materials from landfill.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            We have provided a variety of community activities over the years.\n            Some of you will remember these. They included education courses,\n            furniture restoration, re-use and design. Unemployment drop-in\n            social and recreation activities for all ages and much more.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Trade Base was also the home to many local community groups. We\n            provided free support and advice to enable groups to continue\n            providing their specialist community activities. We held many open\n            days, provided school holiday activities and ran a number of\n            community trips to the seaside.\n          </p>\n\n          <div className=\"mx-auto text-center\">\n            <h2 className=\"inline-block p-1 mb-2 text-l font-bold bg-teal-600 mx-auto text-center text-white uppercase\">\n              All change at Trade Base\n            </h2>\n          </div>\n\n          <p>\n            The ERDF funding finished and the lottery application to purchase\n            the building lease, money for salaries and building improvements was\n            unsuccessful. The project was now running on its reserves, small\n            grants and funds raised from the sale of goods. The Management\n            Committee had to make some hard choices & staffing was reduced to\n            one part time worker.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            A feasibility study was carried out and options were discussed. A\n            plan was developed to continue the project on a smaller scale and to\n            apply for funds for some new outdoor activities.{\" \"}\n          </p>\n\n          <div className=\"mx-auto text-center\">\n            <h2 className=\"inline-block p-1 mb-2 text-l font-bold bg-teal-600 mx-auto text-white uppercase\">\n              The Birth of the Allotment Project\n            </h2>\n          </div>\n\n          <p>\n            Trade Base were renting two plots of land on the Wincobank Allotment\n            site. The workers organised a series of meetings to discuss possible\n            development ideas. During 2004 a small sub group developed an action\n            plan and were successful in securing some Objective One funding to\n            develop a community allotment project. Then is 2007 we were\n            successful in obtaining a grant to sum of Â£190461 from the big\n            lotteries reaching communities fund, this enabled us to fund 2 full\n            time workers for 3 years this enabled us to develop the project even\n            further. Although we met all our targets we failed to get any\n            further significant funding so the project is now purely voluntary\n            and today we see the benefits of years of committment and hard work.\n          </p>\n        </section>\n      </main>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default HistoryPage;\n\nexport const query = graphql`\n  query {\n    file(relativePath: { eq: \"dylan-nolte-dUsmF-F-bJg-unsplash.jpg\" }) {\n      childImageSharp {\n        fluid(maxWidth: 576) {\n          ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n`;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
